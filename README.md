## Fundamental problems very easy 
1. Take N as input. If the number is prime, print “Prime” otherwise print “Not Prime”.
2. Take N as input. Print Nth Fibonacci number. 0 is the 0th Fibonacci number and 1
is 1st Fibonacci number.
3. Take N as input. Calculate its reverse. Print the reverse.
4. Take N as input. Print all prime numbers from 2 to N.
5. Take N as input. Print all Fibonacci numbers less than N.
6. Take N as input. Print the sum of its odd placed digits and sum of its even placed
digits.

## Fundamental problems easy 
1. Take N (number in binary format). Write a function that converts it to decimal format. Print the value returned.
2. Take N (number in decimal format). Write a function that converts it to octal format. Print the value returned.
3. Take N (number in octal format). Write a function that converts it to binary format. Print the value returned.
4. Take sb (source number system base), db (destination number system base) and sn (number in source format). Write a function that converts sn to its counterpart in destination number system. Print the value returned.
